  <h3>George Stubbs</h3>
  <p>Andrew provides excellent service. He communicates efficiently and will always make sure the customer's needs are met.</p>
  <h3>Melanie Bean</h3>
  <p>We can highly recommend Andrew for your mowing needs. He mowed our four acre property last year and we couldn't have been more pleased with his work! He surpassed our expectations by keeping our property perfectly groomed all season long. He is reliable, punctual, and friendly. We will definitely be using Andrew again this year. We couldn't be happier with his work!</p>
  <h3>Ran Chamberlain</h3>
  <p>I am happy to endorse Andrew Knostman in his endeavor to start his lawn care business. He's a fine young man and does an excellent job. He takes the time to make sure the job is done right, and is very reliable. I highly recommend him!</p>
